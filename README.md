Folders named after R scripts contain items referred to in script and items generated by script, excluding items that will be required by future scripts.

This folder or directory has 7 scripts:
	
1. 00_pairs_analysis.R

    - Notes on how to perform the rest of the analyses - no actual code.
	
2. 01_get_acoustic_measures_01.R

    - Filters calls that are too short, transforms time variables.
    	
3. 02_check_session_effect.R

    - Checks effect of session on call rate with plot and ANOVA.
    
4. 03_number_of_calls.R

    - Performs 7 STRAND social relations models, all including age: kinship, food-sharing, grooming, combined affiliation rate, food-sharing AND kinship, grooming AND kinship, affiliation AND kinship.

1. 04_recipient_XX.R

    - One DFA script that works, one pDFA script that doesn't, one random forest script in progress.
    - DFA script splits data by caller and performs one DFA per caller, assigning calls to recipient.


Folders:

1. kinship

    - three different methods Sydney Decker used to calculate kinship. I don't currently know the difference; I just used one that included bat names.

2. not_batcalls

    - spectrograms of 53 detected sounds that were manually designated as NOT bat calls. All calls used were manually designated as bat calls.
    
1. STRAND_results

    - PDFs and JPGs of 21 plots generated by 03_number_of_calls.R


Files:

1. OSU_2024_social_data.csv

    - Haley Gmutza's food-sharing and grooming data
    
2. callerDFAresults.csv

    - results of 04_recipient_DFAs.R

3. campus_bat_chars.csv

    - individual characteristics (age, sex, etc.) of bats in OSU_2024_social_data.csv

4. fundfreq_measures_2025-05-08.RDS

    - Fundamental frequency summary measures.

5. spectro_analysis_2025-05-06.RDS

    - warbleR spectro_analysis results.

6. vocal_data_2024-pairs.RDS

    - All calls with both warbleR and fundamental frequency summary measures.
    
7. vocal_data_2024-pairs_transformed.RDS

    - Above, filtered by call duration and lower bound peakf of 10kHz, with time measures transformed.
